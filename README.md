NOTE:
THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF RRR
http://github.com/ylatif/g2o


Introduction
------------
UPDATE (17/02/2014) : Complete code rewrite to allow extending to various SLAM back-ends <br>
UPDATE : Added timestamps in datasets/B25b/timestamps because of different number of poses in Odometry and Ground Truth g2o files

This project contains the accompanying code for our RSS 2012 paper Robust Loop Closing over time

Requirements
------------

- g2o: http://www.openslam.org/g2o (+ Eigen + libsuitesparse-dev )
- boost math libraries

Installation
-------------

- g2o: 

  Clone from openslam.org or http://github.com/ylatif/g2o <br>
  and install following the instructions provided there in. 
  
- install boost maths ( On ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libboost-math1.42-dev)

- in the directory rrr/<br>
  mkdir build <br>
  cd build <br>
  cmake .. <br>
  make <br>
 
  This will generate examples in the folder rrr/build/examples/
  
Running the examples
--------------------

The example folder contains two executables. 

  ./build/examples/RRR\_3D\_from\_disk\_g2o fixed\_data\_error.g2o 70

The code has been restructured into more organized blocks. The main class of interest is include/RRR.hpp.
Further information on how to use this in your on project can be found in doc/
